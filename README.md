## Why CodeHub?
### Showcase Your Problem-Solving Skills
Having a GitHub repository with your Codewars solutions highlights your dedication to learning and improving as a developer. It serves as a portfolio that recruiters and hiring managers can easily review to see your coding abilities and consistency in action.   

### Track Your Progress
CodeHub organizes all of your Codewars solutions in your repository by difficulty level (6-kyu, 5-kyu, etc.). You can compare your past work with your current abilities, making it easier to see how much you've improved over time.  

### Save Time
CodeHub automates the process of committing and pushing your solutions to GitHub. Once set up, this extension will save you the time and hassle of manually copying, pasting, and uploading each solution to your repository.

## Acknowledgements

### LeetHub
After manually pushing hundreds of my Codewars solutions to GitHub, I searched for a tool to automate the process and came across [LeetHub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) - an extension that does this for LeetCode solutions. While LeetHub wasn’t compatible with Codewars, its core functionality and UI served as an inspiration for the development of CodeHub.

### Frances Coronel
A big thank you to Frances Coronel for her [README template](https://gist.github.com/FrancesCoronel/1bfc2d4aecb01a834b46) - it was a great starting point for structuring the README for this project.
