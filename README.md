### Showcase Your Problem-Solving Skills
Having a GitHub repository with your Codewars solutions highlights your dedication to learning and improving as a developer. It serves as a portfolio that recruiters and hiring managers can easily review to see your coding abilities and consistency in action.   

### Track Your Progress
CodeHub organizes all of your Codewars solutions in your repository by difficulty level (6-kyu, 5-kyu, etc.). You can compare your past work with your current abilities, making it easier to see how much you've improved over time.
